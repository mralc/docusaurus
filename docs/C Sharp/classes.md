title: Classes
---

As C# is a object oriented programming language, is uses objects and classes.

Mean that we can use repeatable  things.

So if you where createng a book store online and wanted to store book info you could make a class which has all the information store in object.

Create a class:

```
class Book
{
    public string title;
    public string author;
    public int pages;
}
```
Create a object of class
```
{
    Book book1 = new Book();
    book1.title = "HP title";
    book1.author = "HP Author";
    book1.page = 400;
}
```
