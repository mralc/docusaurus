# My Coding Journey

This is my Docusaurus site, documents my coding journey. This is where I can quickly come and visit when I need to reference something so that I can write code.

C# and Powershell is the main coding I using, I also put Ruby as this really cool and simple language. Along with Azure DevOps (ADO) as a quick reference or issue i may come across. 

v3.7
