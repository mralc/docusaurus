# My Coding Jounry

This is my Docusaurus site, documents my coding Jounry. This is where I can quickly come aand visit when I need to refrenece something so that I can write code.

C# and Powershell is the main coding I using, I also put Ruby as this really cool and simple lagune.

## Examples

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
