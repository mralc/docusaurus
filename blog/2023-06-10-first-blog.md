So i came across Docusaurus at work and want to understand it better. Also I wanted some where I could document what i learnt when coding. Plus I want somewhere I could quick reference pieces of code I can use day to day that i know work.

Docusaurus is created as a open source project by Facebook. It written in nodeJS and simple to install on windows and linux devices. Follow these step to get a local copy installed on your PC and the pages are just Mark Down files.

I have used a number of things to blog in the past inculding wordpress and staic websites and nothing seems to make it easy. So I am hoping this will help. The soucre code is hosted on GitHub and when a commit is created it is automatticly deployed to ???

As you may all know my grammer and spelling is not great. I hope that people like you can create a pull request to fix them for me. Go head have a go! Just fork this this respoitry to your own github repsotry and clone to your machine, change to directory.

```bash
cd docusaurs
npm run start
```

This this start a local copy of the web server on your PC at http://localhost:3000/. You can edit the mark down files and when you save them the web server auto updates them.

When you have done the changes commit to your repo and then you can create a pull request to merge the changes in to this repo.
