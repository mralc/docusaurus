So i came across Docusaurus at work and wanted to understand it better. Also I wanted some where I could document what I learnt when coding. Plus I want somewhere I could quickly reference pieces of code which I can use day to day that I know work.

I have used a number of things to blog in the past including wordpress and static websites and nothing seems to make it easy. So I am hoping this will help. The source code is hosted on GitHub and when a commit or branched merged into main, it automatic's get to deployed to this site, i am using a nodejs hosting provider [Vercel](https://vercel.com/home)

Docusaurus is created as a open source project by Facebook. It written in nodeJS and is simple to installed on windows and linux. 

Ensure you have the latest version of [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download) installed. We also recommend you install [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#windows-stable) as well.

Follow these [step](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus) to get a local copy installed on your PC and the pages are just Mark Down files. 

Also i am using this plugin for [Search]9https://github.com/gabrielcsapo/docusaurus-plugin-search-local)
