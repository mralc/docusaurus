So i came across Docusaurus at work and wanted to understand it better. Also I wanted some where I could document what I learnt when coding. Plus I want somewhere I could quickly reference pieces of code which I can use day to day that I know work.

Docusaurus is created as a open source project by Facebook. It written in nodeJS and is simple to installed on windows and linux. Follow these step to get a local copy installed on your PC and the pages are just Mark Down files.

I have used a number of things to blog in the past including wordpress and static websites and nothing seems to make it easy. So I am hoping this will help. The source code is hosted on GitHub and when a commit or branched merged into main, it automatic's get to deployed to this site, i am using a nodejs hosting provider [Vercel](https://vercel.com/home)

As you may all know my grammar and spelling is not great. I hope that people like you can create a pull request to fix them for me. Go head have a go! Just fork this this repository to your own github repository and clone to your machine, change to directory which you clone it to.

Ensure you have the latest version of [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download) installed. We also recommend you install [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#windows-stable) as well.

```bash
npm install
npm run start
```

This this start a local copy of Docusaurus on your PC at http://localhost:3000/. You can edit the mark down files and when you save them the web server auto updates them and serve them.

When you have done changes commit to your repo and then you can create a pull request to merge the changes in to this repo and then I can approve them :).
